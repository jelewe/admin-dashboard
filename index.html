                    We don't want to set these clouds on fire. You can do it. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.

                    <strong>Less Cool Project</strong> <br>
                    We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Do an almighty painting with us. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. And maybe a little bush lives there.

                    If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Here we're limited by the time we have. We'll put a happy little sky in here.

                    This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.

                    Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Just make little strokes like that. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Now then, let's play.

                    It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Have fun with it. Learn when to stop.

                    Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Let the paint work. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.

                    We can fix anything. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Let all these things just sort of happen.
